# Branching Strategy
For the branching strategy of my project I will be using GitHub Flow.<br>
Github flow is an alternative to gitflow, but for smaller teams. <br>
Developers create branches that stem from the main branch. This isolates each branch when merged back to the main.<br>
After merging the isolated branch is deleted.

# Git Ignore
There is no explicit git ignore command,therefore the .gitignore file will be edited and committed by manually when I have new files to ignore.

# Credentials and sensitive information
 Add sensitive files to .gitignore <br>
 Dont store any sensitive information on github <br>
 Limit access <br>
 Manage external contributors <br>
 Review code before commit <br>
